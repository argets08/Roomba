<h1>Roomba library for Arduino</h1>
<p>
This is the Arduino <a class="el" href="classRoomba.html" title="Support for iRobot Roomba and Create platforms via serial port using the iRobot Open...">Roomba</a> library. It provides an object-oriented interface for talking to iRobot <a class="el" href="classRoomba.html" title="Support for iRobot Roomba and Create platforms via serial port using the iRobot Open...">Roomba</a> and Create robots via a serial port. The <a class="el" href="classRoomba.html" title="Support for iRobot Roomba and Create platforms via serial port using the iRobot Open...">Roomba</a> is the original device from iRobot. It has a serial port DIN socket on the side. The Create is a more full-featured robot platform for hobbyists. It has both the DIN socket and a DB25 connector called the CArgo Bay Connector<p>
The Create understands a superset of the <a class="el" href="classRoomba.html" title="Support for iRobot Roomba and Create platforms via serial port using the iRobot Open...">Roomba</a> commands. This library supports both devices. Where comands are only available on one or the other platform it is noted.<p>
The version of the package that this documentation refers to can be downloaded from <a href="http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/Roomba/Roomba-1.1.zip">http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/Roomba/Roomba-1.1.zip</a> You can find the latest version at <a href="http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/Roomba">http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/Roomba</a><p>
Tested on Arduino Duemilanove, Diecimila and Mega with arduino-0018 on OpenSuSE 11.1 and avr-libc-1.6.1-1.15, cross-avr-binutils-2.19-9.1, cross-avr-gcc-4.1.3_20080612-26.5.<p>
A number of example programs are included that work with the iRobot Create: <ul>
<li>TestSuite Runs on a Mega and exercises a number of the functions, checking for correct operation </li>
<li>RoombaTest1 Runs in any Arduino, checks that sensors can be read from Create using the stream() command </li>
<li>RoombaRCRx Demo program that shows how to control a Create using the RCRx Arduino library, an Arduino WiFi shield such as BlackWidow and the RCTx iPhone app. Control a Create from your iPhone!</li>
</ul>
A video domonstating this library (along with the <a href="http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/RCKit">http://www.open.com.au/mikem/arduino/RCKit</a> library) being used to control a Create from an iPhone or iPad can be found at <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-5ZOb5WW4">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qv-5ZOb5WW4</a><p>
